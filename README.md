# Odin Recipes

## Description

This is a project showcasing my knowledge of *html* and *css* in the form of a recipes page.
It consists of a main page that links to three other pages, each being a different recipe.

The project is part of [**The Odin Project curriculum**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes)
